## Website for a bookstore

Created a website for bookstore that provides books of many different genres as well as textbooks for grade 12s. 
thought it may seem lacking it serves as a good temple for future enhancement.


## Changes
-Attempted to add a preloader to the website but the animation would not fade away so i have it commented. <br>
-Added a gallery tab with a few book covers when clicked would use a modal to enlage the photos and give the name of the book.<br>
-Added tabs in contact us for the different locations of the bookstore as well as a map in each tab. <br>
-Added a form in both the enquiry and contact us. <br>
-Added an animation for the logo on the homepage and about us. <br>
-added links to 3 social media sites in about us. <br>
Added a book
