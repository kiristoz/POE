## Website for a bookstore

Created a website for bookstore that provides books of many different genres as well as textbooks for grade 12s. 
thought it may seem lacking it serves as a good temple for future enhancement.


## Changes

-Added a gallery tab with a few book covers when clicked would use a modal to enlage the photos and give the name of the book.<br>
-Added tabs in contact us for the different locations of the bookstore as well as a map in each tab. <br>
